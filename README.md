# Books, videos and other recommended education materials

## Machine Learning and Data Science Books

* [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - Excellent and current book for the emerging area of Deep Learning.
* [Doing Data Science](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=vcVKAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=doing+data+science&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiexKHuobfTAhVJqI8KHZUMAhgQ6AEIITAA#v=onepage&q=doing%20data%20science&f=false) - Has chapters with lectures from different industries and how they apply ML. Also, good introductory chapter on how to build an effective Data Science team.
* [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html) - The classic text book for the field. A new edition is coming up shortly and drafts can be found at this link.
* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) - If you're ready to get hands on, this book is an excellent choice. Even covers Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-networks.
* [Reinforcement Learning](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book.html) - If you are ready to delve into Reinforcement Learning, this is the reference text in many (probably most) university classes.
